== Description ==

You can easily configure the sender name and email address and also the mail subject and message.

Attention: This plugin doesn't send the article itself. It just send an mail with a link to the article.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `wp-notify-subscribers` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu  
3. Change the settings under Setting Notify Subscribers

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Is there a limitation to the subscribers? =

No it isn't, but I suggest to limit the number. Because we send an mail with every publish, it will take some time to send the mail. It is ok for up to 50 subscribers, but it can slow down the publishing for more then 100 or thousands subscribers
